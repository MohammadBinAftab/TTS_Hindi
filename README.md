# Text-to-Speech Model Training

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for training a text-to-speech (TTS) model. The goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained TTS model to improve speech quality and adapt to specific speaker characteristics.

## Introduction
This is a Microsoft SpeechT5 model fine-tuned for Hindi.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [Hindi Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skywalker290/hindi-f)
- **Content**:
  - Number of audio files: 16,512
  - Number of speakers: 1
  - Types of speech: Scripted
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Normalization of audio levels
  - Segmentation into shorter clips
  - Tokenization of text data

## Model Architecture
This project utilizes the Microsoft Text-To-Speech architecture, which is based on the Google T5 model.

### Key Features
- [List any specific features or modifications made to the model]

## Approach
The dataset on Kaggle contains WAV files and labels. These are loaded into a dataset dictionary along with their array representation and sampling rate. All characters are extracted, and new characters found in the data are added to the tokenizer. The Speechbrain model generates speaker embeddings to help the model adjust its output.

The dataset is prepared, and longer files are trimmed according to model requirements (SpeechT5 takes 600 tokens of input). The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a data collator is implemented to handle padding. Training arguments are set up along with a remote repository. The model is trained for 7 epochs, with training done in steps to handle limited Colab GPU access, and then pushed to a HuggingFace repository.
